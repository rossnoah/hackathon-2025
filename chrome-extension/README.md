## Installation

### 1. Prepare Icon Assets

The extension needs icon files. You can:

**Option A: Use a simple placeholder**
```bash
# Create simple colored square icons (requires ImageMagick)
cd chrome-extension/icons
convert -size 16x16 xc:#007bff icon16.png
convert -size 48x48 xc:#007bff icon48.png
convert -size 128x128 xc:#007bff icon128.png
```

**Option B: Use a proper icon**
- Create or download PNG icons in 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 sizes
- Place them in `chrome-extension/icons/`
- Name them `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`

### 2. Load Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `chrome-extension` directory
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

## Usage

### First Time Setup

**Note: The API URL is now baked into the extension** - no need to configure the server URL manually!

1. **Configure the API URL (one-time setup):**
   - The API URL is stored in `.env` and `config.js`
   - Current URL: `http://f8g08g0s8ggkcg0g4g8os08s.3.89.141.68.sslip.io`
   - To change it, update both `.env` and `config.js`

2. **Navigate to Moodle:**
   - Go to https://moodle.lafayette.edu/calendar/view.php?view=upcoming&course=1
   - Make sure you're logged in

3. **Configure the extension:**
   - Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
   - Enter your email address (e.g., `your.email@lafayette.edu`)
   - This will auto-register you with the server

### Extract and Sync Assignments

1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Enter your email (if not already saved)
3. Click **Sync Assignments**
4. The extension will:
   - Automatically open the Moodle calendar page (if not already there)
   - Extract all assignments from the page
   - Send them to the server
   - Trigger a push notification to your mobile app
5. The popup will stay open during the process!

## How It Works

### Content Script (`content.js`)
- Runs automatically on Moodle calendar pages
- Extracts assignment data from the DOM:
  - Assignment title
  - Course name
  - Due date and time
  - Description
  - Action URL
- Stores assignments in Chrome's local storage

### Popup (`popup.html` & `popup.js`)
- Provides user interface for:
  - Configuring server URL
  - Triggering manual extraction
  - Viewing extracted assignments
  - Sending data to server

### Server Integration
The extension sends assignment data to these endpoints:

**POST /api/assignments**
```json
{
  "assignments": [
    {
      "id": "3911473",
      "courseId": "30874",
      "title": "Lab 5 is due",
      "course": "ECE 433.01-Fall 2025",
      "date": "Tuesday, October 21",
      "time": "7:00 AM",
      "description": "No late submissions accepted",
      "actionUrl": "https://moodle.lafayette.edu/mod/assign/...",
      "type": "due",
      "component": "mod_assign"
    }
  ],
  "extractedAt": "2025-10-18T20:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**POST /api/send-notification**
- Automatically triggered after syncing assignments
- Sends push notification to all registered mobile devices
