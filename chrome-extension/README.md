convert -size 48x48 xc:#007bff icon48.png
convert -size 128x128 xc:#007bff icon128.png
```

**Option B: Use a proper icon**
- Create or download PNG icons in 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 sizes
- Place them in `chrome-extension/icons/`
- Name them `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`

## How It Works

### Content Script (`content.js`)
- Runs automatically on Moodle calendar pages
- Extracts assignment data from the DOM:
  - Assignment title
  - Course name
  - Due date and time
  - Description
  - Action URL
- Stores assignments in Chrome's local storage

### Popup (`popup.html` & `popup.js`)
- Provides user interface for:
  - Configuring server URL
  - Triggering manual extraction
  - Viewing extracted assignments
  - Sending data to server

### Server Integration
The extension sends assignment data to these endpoints:

**POST /api/assignments**
```json
{
  "assignments": [
    {
      "id": "3911473",
      "courseId": "30874",
      "title": "Lab 5 is due",
      "course": "ECE 433.01-Fall 2025",
      "date": "Tuesday, October 21",
      "time": "7:00 AM",
      "description": "No late submissions accepted",
      "actionUrl": "https://moodle.lafayette.edu/mod/assign/...",
      "type": "due",
      "component": "mod_assign"
    }
  ],
  "extractedAt": "2025-10-18T20:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**POST /api/send-notification**
- Automatically triggered after syncing assignments
- Sends push notification to all registered mobile devices
